    <div class="text-center">What can be more American than a Rodeo! Even though this one bears an import nameplate, the Isuzu Rodeo is assembled in
    Indiana and contains over 70 percent domestic content. Not only has it become Isuzu's best selling model, the Rodeo is
    currently the best selling import brand name sports utility vehicle in America.</div>
    <br>
    <div class="text-center">
    About ten years ago Isuzu got its start in the sports utility vehicle business when it brought the original Trooper II
    over here. In a short time this two-door, four-cylinder, two and four-wheel drive multi- purpose unit evolved into a
    full-powered, fully equipped, four-door V- 6. In the mid-eighties Isuzu realized that the less expensive end of this
    market could use a new model, and it began developing the slightly smaller Rodeo. It was specifically designed to be
    constructed and sold in this country. It is assembled in the joint venture Subaru-Isuzu plant in Indiana, where the
    first Rodeos debuted in 1990.

    <br>
    <div class="text-center">
    To give it greater performance and appeal for 1993, Isuzu installed a new and improved V-6 in the Rodeo. It replaced the
    aging GM-built 2.8 liter, 120 horsepower, pushrod V-6, with a 24-valve, multi- port fuel injected, overhead cam V-6 of
    its own design and manufacture that displaces 3.2 liters, develops 175 horsepower and offers slightly better fuel
    economy.</div>
